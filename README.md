# Team 16 - Successorator 
Velocity Estimation 
Based on milestone 1, we believe that we underestimated the task-length time. Also, we struggled a lot with GitHub. Thus, our estimated new initial velocity is 0.6 since 
Our new hour estimations from planning poker have gone up significantly (as we largely based our estimations on our experience during the milestone 1 developing phase). 
We have much more experience using GitHub and Android software now than we did during the milestone 1 developing phase. 
We need to finish up a few leftover tasks from the first milestone. 
Hence, 0.6 velocity should be a good estimate.

This is the mostly empty template for the Successorator project.

## Getting Started

 - [X] Look around the project.
   - The `docs/` directory may be helpful, as Slack/Discord messages are easy to lose.
     - This is a good place to put finalized user stories, standards, guidelines, meeting notes, etc
       that you want to stick with the repository in perpetuity (e.g. after the semester ends) e.g.
       for portfolio purposes.
     - Google Docs is easier for collaboration, but eventually you might want to put the
       finalized versions here for reference. (This way you can also reference them in PRs!)
 - [X] Modify the `.github/pull_request_template.md` to suit your needs.
   - You **do not** need to use the exact same template, but justify your changes when you 
     PR the updated template.
 - [X] Replace this README with something appropriate.
   - **When you do, replace the title to replace X with your team number.**
